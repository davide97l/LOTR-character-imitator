# LOTR Character Imitator

Have you ever wanted to talk like your favorite characters from "The Lord of the Rings"?

With this project, you can! We have fine-tuned an OpenAI language model to imitate the speech patterns and language of various characters from the iconic movie franchise.

Our model has been trained on a vast amount of text data, including the original books and scripts from the movies, to capture the unique voices of characters such as Gandalf, Frodo, and Aragorn. Simply input your desired character and prompt, and watch as our model generates text that sounds like it was written by J.R.R. Tolkien himself!

## Dataset

### Kaggle data

The Lord of the Rings characters dialogue data is available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data).

### ChatGPT-generated data {#chatgpt-data}

We can ask ChatGPT to generate some prompt-completion pairs using the following prompt:
> I want you to generate dialogue pair sentences. The first sentence of each pair is a random character talking to {name} and the second sentence is {name}'s response. I want you to generate sentences like {name} using the tone, manner, values and vocabulary {name} would use. Do not write any explanations. Only talk like {name}.

## Data preprocessing

Preprocess the data by running the `format_data.py` script.
Make sure the `lotr_scripts.csv` file is in the directory `data`. If not, you can download it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data).
```
python format_data.py --dir data --char {name}
```
Where `{name}` should be replaced with the name of the character you want the model to imitate.

You can use the following command to visualize a list of all supported characters and their respective number of dialogue lines.
```
python format_data.py --show_chars True
```

**BONUS**: use ChatGPT generated data to augment the dataset. 
- Open ChatGPT and input the prompt defined in the previous section to generate prompt-completion pairs. Replace `{name}` with the name of your character.
- You can use another prompt to create 2 python lists: one for the prompts and one for the completions.
    > Given the previous text generate 2 python lists of string: one for the text spoken by Character and one for {name}
- Add the resulted lists in the file `background.py` respecting the predefined format.
- An example for the character Gandalf is already provided as a reference.

## Fine-tuning
Add your OpanAI key.
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```
**Optional**: check the data is in the right format. 
```
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f lotr_scripts_{name}.jsonl
```
Start a fine-tuning job.
```
openai api fine_tunes.create -t lotr_scripts_{name}.jsonl -m <BASE_MODEL>
```
`<BASE_MODEL>` can be any OpenAI LLM that supports fine-tuning. For example, you can choose `curie` or `davinci`.

Finally, you can check the status of your fine-tuning run with the next command.
```
openai api fine_tunes.follow -i <YOUR_FINE_TUNE_JOB_ID>
```
